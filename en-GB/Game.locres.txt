BookDownstairs.ReadView=after having dwelled far too long on what the rejection paper had stated in plain terms. Outside the fog was coalescing into a person standing at the front door. Another unwanted memory. If Tali had made her break with the kind of permanence that instincts told her to risk, she would have burned it with all the rest.<lf><lf>“Throw chaos into the entire system,” she said to no one. Her admission masqueraded as bravado, a reaction that had been pushing through the cracks lately. She might regret this tomorrow and without a bottle of ambrosia or shared bed to crawl into. Doom was heralding her name alone — and she almost welcomed it.<lf><lf>Now that the environment had shifted to something far more stable, it seemed a safe enough time to start testing the area for reality bubbles. She entered the atrium, adjusted her equipment and scanned the interior.<lf><lf>Third instance.<lf>No unreality tears in matter or energy.<lf>Systems nominal.<lf><lf>She frowned. The final, hardwired statement was lying to her. That status hadn’t been accurate for objective years. Still, mock or hope, it was better than complications the crew had no time to recalibrate before brain death occurred. With a little luck, she might survive this dive.<lf><lf>The adjacent doorway had been wrenched open by a powerful force. That alone was evidence that she was finally on the verge of success despite the implied danger. She passed over the first threshold. A babbling noise came from the darkened monitor across the room. As she approached, it resolved into muffled crying as if submerged countless fathoms below. Then she realised: that was churning ichor! Without hesitation, she plunged her arms inside.<lf><lf>Nothingness had a feeling.<lf><lf>As always, there was no physical sensation of moving her hands inside the void-womb, only a phantom memory afterwards… probing… reaching… barely missing the thing that was… a titan! It had to be one hiding. If only she could extend her hand one… more… inch...!<lf><lf>An echo of violence, like a guillotine on a piano, fell scant feet away from her position. She yanked her hands from the ichor. Her heart hammered, a prisoner within a rib cage. That was closer than last time. Undeterred, frustrated at losing the chance to grab a defenceless titan, she inspected the source of the noise. The air was vibrating in the pattern of a song she hated. Must have been for effect.<lf><lf>Her fingers danced. She called the song forth, only out of spite and to prove to whatever was watching her: she was in control.<lf><lf>“Acheron!”<lf><lf>The peal came from the atrium.<lf><lf>“Acheron! Acheron!” The Retribution’s XO demanded her attention, frustratingly ill-timed. “Acheron!”<lf><lf>Tali stormed into the atrium, answered the call and heard nothing. Dead air buzz and the tone of failed connection. Her equipment was being destroyed from the inside out like her. But then a similar drone began emanating from the ichor-filled monitor back in the other room. She returned and watched it. Expectations sinking.<lf><lf>Yet it appeared: two alternating images of the long-extinct past and the never-to-exist future. Timelines she knew. Timelines so painful, they never stopped weighing down her mind whenever it drifted towards the peaceful sleep denied to her night after night. The price of necro-physics? The images stopped flipping, froze on a single frame.<lf><lf>The Astronaut stared back.<lf><lf>Recognising the background, Tali rushed to the hallway connecting the atrium with

For the first time since the ship’s fatal accident, Tali felt alive.<lf><lf>“They are burning to ashes,” she admitted in a detached voice no longer her own, feeling the bulkhead against her pinned shoulders reverberating as another god guttered into smoke in the engine’s crematorium. “You will not get him back.

She had to extend some respect to it for being as driven as she was.<lf><lf>Her starship would crash. That is inevitable now. The descent is predictable, its mathematics a sickening prophecy. But there is an if outcome remaining, assuming she can have the words of it interpreted another way by Oracle.<lf><lf>Amid the destruction spreading from the hole pierced through the hull of Retribution, Tali Acheron finds her centre. The blood soaking up through her pants is absorbed into her veins. Heart rate quickens into the thrill of adrenaline, the unconscious patterns her fingertips lightly draw in the aether. That which destroys now creates. There can be no paradoxes in a world without end or beginning.<lf><lf>EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED IN MY DOMAIN.<lf><lf>In the Astral, she turns the regret-rusted key in the lock. The door opens. Solace. Now returning to the hallway where she chased Astronaut to the shadow-stained gate. Though the barrier pushed her away before, she finally has the means to compel entry.<lf><lf>“Mother’s ire.

Glory: reignite the sun,” Tali intones.<lf><lf>Silence.<lf><lf>“GLORY.” The booming voice of Oracle, ten million whispers united into the unyielding force of eternity.<lf><lf>The sunface totem evaporates from Tali’s second sight.

We must die to live.<lf><lf>And the gate shimmers to transparency, allowing the first mortal passage in countless millennia. Tali descends into Pythia’s inner sanctum. Each step, eternity’s weight.

Most hostiles can be staggered with a <n1>melee attack</> or by dealing enough damage.<lf><lf>The stagger bar indicates how close a hostile is to staggering.<lf><lf>Hitting the hostile's <n1>weak point</> deals additional damage and staggers them faster.

TutorialMenu.Malfunctions=Your suit can <n2>Malfunction</> when coming in contact with <n2>Malignant</> entities, such as containers, Consumables or even certain enemy projectiles.

TutorialMenu.Parasites=<n1>Parasites</> are strange fauna that infest Atropos and affect your Suit in different ways. While some might alter the way your Suit is repaired, others can prevent death entirely.

TutorialMenu.ScoreSystem=In the Tower your cycles are scored based on your performance. Clear Tower floors, defeat hostiles and collect Calibrators while maintaining your <n1>Adrenaline Level</> to increase your <n1>Score</>.

The decay speeds up the higher up the Tower you go.<lf><lf>While in the Tower, all cycles will start in the atrium, where you can also find the Tower exit device.
TutorialMenu.Superweapon=<n1>Disgorgers</> are exceptionally powerful weapons with varying effects. They are equipped in the Consumables slot, and expire once their charge depletes.
